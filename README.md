## Introduction.

Hi there, what's up? Welcome to all the entrepeneurs, artists and web developers out there!

My name is Archie and in this video tutorial, I am going to teach you about how to create expert level web animation projects over the next few hours.

We will start with a blank canvas and we will end up with an insanely cool web animation page that you can publish to your website at the end!

In between start and finish, we will look at sketching drafts, illustration, animation techniques such as stop frame and video, then we will convert our assets into a fully functional web page, highly optimised for speed, using all the latest tech stacks.

## About me.

Since I was a kid, I loved to draw all the time. I mixed that love with computers and set up my own web development company called Archibald Butler ltd in 2007.

Clients I have worked for include Apple, Gucci, marketing mogul WPP, Crypto's Ripple XRP coin, the ASOS fashion website and many many more(show logos). My contracts can be a week to 6 months long. Nowadays I spend a lot of my professional time writing Javascript for my clients. 

In my spare time I started developing this responsive framework for building web page illustrations and animations. Having done a few now, I thought I would release the tutorial!

Oh, yeah and my hobby is surfing (Show clips with music?)

Let's get started right now!

## Why are we doing this?

We should have some fun along the way while we go through everything an artist would need to go from a concept to a highly creative web page. We are going to gain experience in:

- Sketching
- Painting
- Inking
- Apple Pen with Pro Create
- Using Photoshop and Illustrator
- Exporting assets for web correctly.
- Writing HTML and CSS to display our work
- Touch on some basic animation techniques on the web
- Write the main Javascript animation concepts
- Publish our art to a web page
- Convert it to be used in React Js

You could then adapt these techniques to create a digital art services business of your own that is relfective of your own style. You could also use this tutorial to create your own highly bespoke website.

## Get a cool client

Ok so the plan for this tutorial is to find a cool business and make them an awesome responsive illustrated web page, we could even hope they use it as their web homepage. Maybe they would use it in an email shout out too. 

Let's write to them !

Hi there XXX,

My name is Archie and I am a professional web developer and artist that lives nearby with nearly 20 years of industry experience.

There is a new project that I am working on right now:

I am making a video tutorial about making a web page with custom art, for a business.

Would you be interested in having a video call for a few minutes to talk about it?

I would like to make XXX the subject business of my video.

Here are some examples of my art:

I am doing this 100% free too. All I ask for is some of your time for some video calls and some face to face video interviews about the work during the whole creation and afterwards. These will then be included in my video tutorial and published to online learning websites like Udemy and Skillshare.
